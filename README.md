## <a name="what-is-it"></a>What is it?

This plugin extends [Eclipseâ“‡](https://eclipse.org) with a **Find/Replace** view that allows to conveniently
perform find/replace operations within the currently active editor.

The following hot keys are configured by default:
- [CTRL]+[ALT]+[F] - open the **F**ind/Replace view
- [CTRL]+[ALT]+[N] - go to the **n**ext match
- [CTRL]+[ALT]+[P] - go to the **p**revious match
- [ESC] - return focus to the editor (default) or close the Find/Replace view. can be configured in the preferences

This plugin is a spiritual successor to the abandoned [Eclipse Search Tab](https://code.google.com/archive/p/eclipse-search-tab/) plug-in
which aimed to provide a Firefox-like search tab.

## <a id="building"></a>Building from Sources

To ensure reproducible builds this Maven project inherits from the [vegardit-maven-parent](https://github.com/vegardit/vegardit-maven-parent)
project which declares fixed versions and sensible default settings for all official Maven plug-ins.

The project also uses the [maven-toolchains-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-toolchains-plugin/) which decouples the JDK that is
used to execute Maven and it's plug-ins from the target JDK that is used for compilation and/or unit testing. This ensures full binary
compatibility of the compiled artifacts with the runtime library of the required target JDK.

To build the project follow these steps:

1. Download and install a Java 17 SDK, e.g. from:
   - https://adoptium.net/releases.html?variant=openjdk17
   - https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk

1. Download and install the latest [Maven distribution](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

1. In your user home directory create the file `.m2/toolchains.xml` with the following content:

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF8"?>
   <toolchains>
      <toolchain>
         <type>jdk</type>
         <provides>
            <version>17</version>
            <vendor>default</vendor>
         </provides>
         <configuration>
            <jdkHome>[PATH_TO_YOUR_JDK_17]</jdkHome>
         </configuration>
      </toolchain>
   </toolchains>
   ```

   Set the `[PATH_TO_YOUR_JDK_17]` parameter accordingly.

1. Checkout the code using one of the following methods:

    - `git clone https://github.com/sebthom/findview-eclipse-plugin`
    - `svn co https://github.com/sebthom/findview-eclipse-plugin findview-eclipse-plugin`

1. Run `mvn clean verify` in the project root directory. This will execute compilation, unit-testing, integration-testing and
   packaging of all artifacts.
